# Robotic-Arm-Project
This project demonstrates a smartphone-controlled robotic arm built using Bluetooth communication for real-time object manipulation.

The goal was to create a simple, low-cost robotic system that allows users to control arm movements directly from a mobile application, ensuring smooth motion, precision, and reliable wireless performance.

The mobile app was designed to send control commands via Bluetooth to an Arduino-based system, which executes movement instructions through servo motors. Custom control logic was implemented to ensure accurate positioning and stable gripper operation.
